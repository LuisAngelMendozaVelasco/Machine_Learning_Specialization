# Reinforcement learning

This week, you will learn about reinforcement learning, and build a deep Q-learning neural network in order to land a virtual lunar lander on Mars!

## Learning Objectives

- Understand key terms such as return, state, action, and policy as it applies to reinforcement learning
- Understand the Bellman equations
- Understand the state-action value function
- Understand continuous state spaces
- Build a deep Q-learning network
