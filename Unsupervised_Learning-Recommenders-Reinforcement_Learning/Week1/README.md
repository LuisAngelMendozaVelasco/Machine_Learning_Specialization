# Unsupervised learning

This week, you will learn two key unsupervised learning algorithms: clustering and anomaly detection

## Learning Objectives

- Implement the k-means clustering algorithm
- Implement the k-means optimization objective
- Initialize the k-means algorithm
- Choose the number of clusters for the k-means algorithm
- Implement an anomaly detection system
- Decide when to use supervised learning vs. anomaly detection
- Implement the centroid update function in k-means
- Implement the function that finds the closest centroids to each point in k-means
